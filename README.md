- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phil271
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, SQL, Analytics, data streaming, cloud storage, animation using Blender, and as a Chemical Engineer, capturing carbon dioxide.
. As a top graduate in Systems Design and Computer Programming years ago, I am now looking towards work with databases and data analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Blender, and how to add data pipelines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the future after I am more proficient.
-. Looking forward to contributing and to learning on GitHub😊.
